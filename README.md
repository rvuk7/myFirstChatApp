myFirstChatApp

This is my first solo ReactJS project that was made for a final paper as part of my front end development course on Algebra University College. It's a simple Chat Application that, upon joining, generates random username and color (avatar) for it's users which follow them for the rest of their "chatting". The application is connected via Scaledrone which enables real time conversation/chat between different users.

To check out the functionalities of this project please do the following:

```
Clone this repository
Run npm install
Run npm start (as many times you'd like to simulate a conversation between different users).
```

Enjoy! :)
